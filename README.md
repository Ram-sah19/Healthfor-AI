# HealthForecast AI

**Hospital Readmission Prediction & Patient Risk Intelligence System**

An AI-powered healthcare analytics platform that predicts hospital readmissions,
identifies high-risk patients, evaluates treatment effectiveness and supports
proactive patient care planning.

> **Interns start here: [INTERN_GUIDE.md](INTERN_GUIDE.md).**
> You work on your own branch. Nothing is merged into `main`.

---

## What it does

The platform helps hospitals reduce unnecessary readmissions, improve patient
outcomes and optimise healthcare resources through patient risk prediction,
readmission forecasting, treatment effectiveness analysis and hospital
performance reporting.

Intended users: hospitals, healthcare providers, clinics, insurance companies,
healthcare researchers and public health organisations.

## Modules

| # | Module | Capability |
|---|--------|-----------|
| 1 | User Management | Doctor and administrator accounts, authentication, role management |
| 2 | Patient Data Management | Patient records, medical history, treatment and admission tracking |
| 3 | Risk Prediction | Risk analysis, readmission probability, high-risk identification |
| 4 | Treatment Effectiveness | Outcome evaluation, recovery and medication effectiveness analysis |
| 5 | Clinical Decision Support | Care recommendations, follow-up planning, discharge support |
| 6 | Healthcare Analytics Dashboard | Readmission analytics, hospital performance, trend visualisation |
| 7 | AI Model Management | Model training, evaluation, prediction monitoring, optimisation |

## Roles

Four roles, each with a distinct view of the data. The full access matrix is in
[`docs/04-rbac/`](docs/04-rbac/) and is enforced in code by
[`backend/app/core/rbac.py`](backend/app/core/rbac.py).

| Role | Sees |
|------|------|
| **Doctor** | Assigned patients, their risk predictions and care recommendations |
| **Hospital Administrator** | Hospital-wide analytics and performance, read-only on records |
| **Healthcare Researcher** | Anonymised cohorts and aggregated statistics only |
| **System Administrator** | Everything, plus user and model management |

## Tech stack

| Layer | Technology |

### What works today

`main` carries a working reference implementation of Milestones 1 and 2:

- JWT authentication with bcrypt hashing, audited logins, and immediate session
  revocation when an account is deactivated
- The full access matrix enforced in code and pinned by tests, with scoping
  applied inside the SQL query rather than after it
- Patient management with search, pagination and admission history
- Role-aware dashboards for all four roles, built from real aggregates
- The Diabetes 130-US Hospitals dataset loaded: 101,766 raw encounters cleaned
  to 69,990, an 8.98% 30-day readmission rate
- 30-day readmission risk scoring: a calibrated model serving real-time and
  batch predictions, risk banding, forecasting and global risk drivers.
  ROC-AUC 0.65; the high band runs **2.86x** the baseline readmission rate, and
  the forecast lands within **1.6%** of the observed count

Treatment effectiveness analysis is implemented on `intern/13-rambilas-sah`
(Milestone 3). `GET /api/v1/treatment/summary`, `/medications` and
`/recovery-trends` aggregate outcomes in SQL over `treatment_outcomes` joined to
its admission and patient - no reference baselines and no synthesised trend
series, so an empty table renders an empty state. Each figure is a documented
proxy: success means no 30-day readmission, a complication means the episode
ended somewhere other than home, and recovery is a composite index above a
stated target. Doctors hold `treatment_report:read_limited`, which returns the
same aggregation narrowed to their own caseload inside the `WHERE` clause.
Demo seed included; 119 backend tests pass. Analytics dashboards for the
hospital-admin and researcher screens remain outstanding.

[milestone-3](MILESTONE_3_REPORT.md).

## Continuous integration

CI runs on **every branch**, and skips the jobs whose folders do not exist yet,
so an early branch is not failed for work that has not started.

| Workflow | Trigger | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| [CI](.github/workflows/ci.yml) | Every push and pull request | Repository checks, backend, frontend, ML, Docker |
| [Branch guard](.github/workflows/branch-guard.yml) | Pull requests | Blocks pull requests into `main` |
| [Security](.github/workflows/security.yml) | Every push, weekly | `pip-audit`, `npm audit`, CodeQL |
| [Cohort report](.github/workflows/cohort-report.yml) | Weekly, on demand | Every intern in the roster: branch, commits ahead, CI result, last push |
| [Deploy](.github/workflows/deploy.yml) | Manual only | Milestone 4: verify, build images, release to your environment |

The full list of checks and how to run them locally is in
[INTERN_GUIDE.md](INTERN_GUIDE.md#6-what-ci-checks).

## ⚙️ Installation & Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v18.0.0 or higher)
- **MongoDB** (Local instance running at `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017` or MongoDB Atlas URI)
- **npm** or **yarn**

---

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# (Optional) Seed the database with initial users and patient records
npm run seed

# Start the backend server
npm run dev
```
> 🚀 Backend API will be running at: `http://localhost:8000`  
> 🔍 API Health check endpoint: `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health`

---

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the Vite development server
npm run dev
```
> 🌐 Frontend Application will be accessible at: `http://localhost:5173`

---

## 🔑 Default Test Credentials

The accounts the FastAPI service seeds, from `backend/app/db/init_db.py`:

| Role | Email | Password | Default Landing Page |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🩺 **Doctor / Clinician** | `dr.reddy@healthforecast.org` | `password123` | `/doctor/dashboard` |
| 🩺 **Doctor (2nd)** | `dr.mehta@healthforecast.org` | `password123` | `/doctor/dashboard` |
| 🏦 **Hospital Administrator** | `admin.ops@healthforecast.org` | `password123` | `/hospital-admin/dashboard` |
| 🧪 **Healthcare Researcher** | `researcher@healthforecast.org` | `password123` | `/researcher/dashboard` |
| 💻 **System Administrator** | `admin@healthforecast.org` | `password123` | `/system-admin/dashboard` |

`password123` is whatever you seed with — the login page prefills this value, so
run `SEED_PASSWORD='password123' python -m app.db.init_db` for the role buttons to
work click-through. Two doctors exist so caseload scoping is demonstrable.
