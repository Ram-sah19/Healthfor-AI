"""Loading and serving the trained readmission risk model.

Milestone 2. The artifact produced by `ml/src/models/train.py` is a dict holding
the fitted sklearn pipeline plus everything needed to serve it reproducibly: the
model name and version, the tuned decision threshold, the feature columns it was
fitted on, and its test metrics.

The model is loaded lazily and cached. A missing artifact is not a crash - the
API degrades to "model not loaded" so the rest of the platform keeps working.
